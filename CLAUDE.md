# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project directory for "appboardguru" that has not yet been initialized. The project structure and architecture details will be added as the codebase develops.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the following steps may be needed to get started:

1. Initialize git repository: `git init`
2. Add project files and dependencies based on the technology stack chosen
3. Set up package management (npm, yarn, pip, etc.) as appropriate
4. Configure build and development tools

## Common Commands

*Commands will be added here once the project tooling is established*

## Architecture Notes

*Architecture details will be documented here as the codebase grows*

---

*This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project develops to include specific build commands, testing procedures, and architectural decisions.*
