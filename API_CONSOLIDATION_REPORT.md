### 3. Architectural Patterns Implemented

#### Enhanced Middleware System
```typescript
// Consistent patterns across all controllers
export const createHandler = EnhancedHandlers.post(
  ValidationSchema,
  {
    rateLimit: { requests: 50, window: '1m' },
    authenticate: true,
    cache: { ttl: 300 },
    audit: true,
    featureFlag: 'USE_NEW_API_LAYER'
  },
  async (req) => { /* handler logic */ }
)
```

#### Validation & Type Safety
- **Zod Schemas**: Comprehensive input validation for all controllers
- **Type Definitions**: Full TypeScript integration with database types
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes

#### Security & Performance  
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured per endpoint based on usage patterns
- **Caching**: Strategic caching for read-heavy operations
- **Authentication**: Consistent auth patterns across all protected routes
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

### 4. Route Migration Strategy

Each controller maintains Next.js App Router compatibility through delegation:

```typescript
// Original route: /api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts
export { verifyOtp as POST } from '../../controllers/auth.controller'

// New consolidated logic in controller with enhanced features
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing API consumers
- ✅ Gradual migration path (`.new.ts` files for testing)
- ✅ Enhanced functionality without disruption
- ✅ Consistent patterns across all routes

### 5. Performance Improvements

#### Caching Strategy
- **Health Checks**: 15-30 second cache for monitoring endpoints
- **Asset Lists**: 3-minute cache with invalidation on updates  
- **Notification Counts**: 30-second cache for real-time updates
- **Search Results**: 2-minute cache for complex queries

#### Rate Limiting
- **Authentication**: 5 OTP attempts per 15 minutes
- **Asset Operations**: 50 requests per minute for modifications
- **Health Checks**: 1000+ requests per minute for monitoring
- **Bulk Operations**: 20-30 requests per minute to prevent abuse

### 6. Error Handling & Monitoring

#### Structured Error Responses
```typescript
{
  error: "Detailed error message",
  code: "ERROR_CODE",
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  requestId: "req_123456",
  details: { /* contextual information */ }
}
```

#### Comprehensive Logging
- **Activity Logging**: User actions tracked with context
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and resource usage
- **Error Tracking**: Structured error logs with correlation IDs
- **Audit Trails**: Compliance-ready audit logs

### 7. Remaining Controllers (Recommended)
