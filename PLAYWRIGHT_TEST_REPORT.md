# AppBoardGuru - Comprehensive Playwright Test Report

## Test Date: January 4, 2025

## Executive Summary

Extensive testing was performed on the AppBoardGuru application using Playwright automation. The testing revealed critical issues with the deployment pipeline and database configuration that are preventing the application from functioning properly.

## Test Environment

- **Local Development**: http://localhost:3000
- **Production URL**: https://appboardguru.vercel.app (DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND)
- **Browser**: Chromium (Headless: false)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080

## Test Results Summary

### ❌ Critical Issues Found

1. **Production Deployment Failure**
   - Status: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
   - The Vercel deployment is completely broken
   - Multiple attempts to access production URLs return 404 errors

2. **Database Migration Issues**
   - Missing tables: `asset_annotations`, `annotation_replies`, `vault_assets`
   - Missing columns: `organization_id` and `vault_id` in assets table
   - Multiple 406 and 500 errors when accessing database

3. **React Rendering Errors**
   - "React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child"
   - Components failing to render due to missing data

4. **Static Asset Loading Failures**
   - 404 errors for CSS files
   - 404 errors for JavaScript chunks
   - Missing favicon and other static resources

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Authentication Testing ✅ Partial Success

**Test Performed:**
- Navigate to sign-in page
- Enter test credentials
- Submit login form

**Results:**
- Authentication backend works (session established)
- User: test.director@appboardguru.com successfully authenticated
- Session cookie properly set
- However, post-login redirect fails due to rendering errors

**Console Output:**
```
[AuthContext] Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN
Login successful, session established
```

### 2. Documents Feature Testing ❌ Failed

**Test Performed:**
- Navigate to /dashboard/documents
- Check for Documents menu item
- Verify page loads correctly

**Results:**
- Page fails to render (blank screen)
- Database tables not found (migrations not applied)
- Multiple 404 and 500 errors

### 3. Dashboard Testing ❌ Failed

**Test Performed:**
- Navigate to /dashboard
- Check sidebar navigation
- Verify dashboard components load

**Results:**
- Blank page displayed
- React component errors prevent rendering
- API endpoints returning 500 errors

### 4. API Endpoint Testing ❌ Failed

**Failed Endpoints:**
- `/api/organizations/basic?userId=...` - 500 Internal Server Error
- `/rest/v1/users` - 406 Not Acceptable
- `/rest/v1/user_profiles` - 404 Not Found
- `/rest/v1/user_preferences` - 404 Not Found

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
The application expects database tables and columns that don't exist:
- Migration script exists (`20250103_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION.sql`)
- Migration has NOT been applied to production
- This causes cascading failures throughout the application

### 2. Vercel Deployment Disconnect
- GitHub repository is not properly connected to Vercel
- Pushes to main branch are not triggering deployments
- Environment variables may be set but deployment itself is missing

### 3. Development Environment Issues
- Multiple React component errors
- Missing proper error boundaries
- No graceful degradation when data is unavailable

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix Vercel Deployment** (Priority 1)
   - Reconnect GitHub repository to Vercel project
   - Verify webhook configuration
   - Ensure build command and environment variables are correct

2. **Apply Database Migrations** (Priority 1)
   - Run `20250103_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION.sql` in Supabase
   - Verify all tables and columns are created
   - Test database connectivity

3. **Fix React Component Errors** (Priority 2)
   - Add proper error boundaries
   - Handle missing data gracefully
   - Fix "React.Children.only" errors in Select components

4. **Resolve Static Asset Issues** (Priority 3)
   - Verify build output includes all static files
   - Check Next.js configuration for asset handling
   - Ensure proper caching headers

## Test Artifacts

### Screenshots Captured:
1. Landing page - Shows initial load
2. Sign-in page - Authentication form visible
3. Post-login attempt - Blank screen due to errors
4. Dashboard attempt - Blank screen
5. Documents page attempt - Blank screen

### Console Logs:
- 27 total console errors captured
- Majority are 404 (Not Found) errors
- Multiple React rendering errors
- Database connection failures

## Conclusion

The application has critical infrastructure issues that prevent it from functioning. While the authentication system partially works, the lack of proper database schema and broken deployment pipeline make the application unusable in its current state.

**Overall Test Status: ❌ FAILED**

The application requires immediate attention to:
1. Fix the Vercel deployment pipeline
2. Apply database migrations
3. Resolve React component errors

Once these issues are addressed, comprehensive testing should be re-run to verify all features work correctly.
