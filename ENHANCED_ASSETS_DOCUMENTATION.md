## Integration Points

### API Endpoints Enhanced

The system integrates with existing API endpoints and extends them:

```typescript
// Enhanced asset controller methods
GET    /api/assets              // List with advanced filtering
POST   /api/assets              // Create with metadata
GET    /api/assets/[id]          // Get with version history
PUT    /api/assets/[id]          // Update with versioning
DELETE /api/assets/[id]          // Soft delete with audit
POST   /api/assets/[id]/share    // Share with granular permissions
GET    /api/assets/search        // Advanced search with content indexing

// New endpoints for enhanced features
POST   /api/assets/upload/chunk     // Chunked upload endpoint
POST   /api/assets/upload/finalize  // Finalize chunked upload
GET    /api/assets/[id]/versions    // Version history
POST   /api/assets/[id]/versions    // Create new version
GET    /api/assets/versions/compare // Compare versions
POST   /api/assets/bulk             // Bulk operations
```

### Database Schema Extensions

Enhanced database support for new features:

```sql
-- Asset versions table
CREATE TABLE asset_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  asset_id UUID REFERENCES assets(id),
  version_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  change_description TEXT,
  is_major_version BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Folder structure table
CREATE TABLE folders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  parent_id UUID REFERENCES folders(id),
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Full-text search index
CREATE INDEX assets_content_search 
ON assets USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description));
```
