### **Technical Architecture**

#### **Advanced Algorithms**
```typescript
// Force-directed layout with customizable parameters
const positions = this.calculateForceDirectedLayout(nodes, links, {
  attraction: 0.1,
  repulsion: 100,
  damping: 0.9,
  iterations: 1000
})

// Network analytics with multiple centrality measures
const analytics = this.calculateNetworkAnalytics(networkData)
// Returns: density, clustering coefficient, key influencers, isolated nodes
```

#### **Three.js Integration**
```typescript
// Interactive 3D nodes with physics-based animation
<NetworkNode
  node={node}
  onClick={onNodeClick}
  isSelected={selectedNode?.id === node.id}
  isHovered={hoveredNode?.id === node.id}
  onHover={onNodeHover}
/>
```

### **User Experience**

#### **Intuitive Interactions**
1. **Orbit Controls** - Mouse/touch navigation around 3D space
2. **Node Selection** - Click nodes to view detailed information
3. **Hover Tooltips** - Rich information on mouse hover
4. **Voice Queries** - Natural language network exploration
5. **Layout Switching** - Real-time algorithm changes
6. **Export Options** - Save network data as JSON

#### **Visual Design**
- **Role-Based Colors** - Purple (owner), Blue (admin), Green (member), Gray (viewer)
- **Influence Indicators** - Golden spheres for high-influence members
- **Connection Strength** - Red (strong), Amber (medium), Gray (weak)
- **Smooth Animations** - 60fps rendering with optimized performance
- **Responsive Layout** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### **Performance Optimizations**

#### **Rendering Performance**
