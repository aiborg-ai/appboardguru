# Webpack Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the webpack optimization strategies implemented to resolve build errors and improve performance in the AppBoardGuru application.

## Problem Statement
The application was experiencing persistent webpack cache errors during development:
- `[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack: Error: ENOENT`
- Slow build times (6-10 seconds)
- Large cache sizes (1.5GB+)
- Development friction due to cache corruption

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Next.js Configuration
The `next.config.js` has been optimized with:

#### Cache Management
- **Production Cache**: Filesystem cache with compression and versioning
- **Development Cache**: Managed by Next.js internally for stability
- **Cache Directory**: Absolute paths to prevent ENOENT errors
- **Hash Algorithm**: xxhash64 for faster hashing

#### Module Resolution
- **Extensions**: Prioritized TypeScript extensions for faster resolution
- **Symlinks**: Disabled for better performance
- **Context Cache**: Disabled to improve resolution speed

#### Code Splitting Strategy
```javascript
splitChunks: {
  chunks: 'all',
  cacheGroups: {
    vendor: { /* All node_modules */ },
    react: { /* React specific */ },
    supabase: { /* Supabase SDK */ },
    common: { /* Shared components */ }
  }
}
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Watch Options**: Optimized file watching with ignore patterns
- **Performance Hints**: Disabled in development
- **Module IDs**: Deterministic for better caching
- **Runtime Chunk**: Separated for better cache invalidation

### 2. Cache Management Scripts

#### Clean Cache Script (`scripts/clean-cache.sh`)
- Stops running Next.js processes
- Removes .next directory safely
- Clears node_modules cache
- Fixes file permissions
- Creates fresh cache directories

**Usage**: `npm run clean:cache`

#### Webpack Monitor (`scripts/webpack-monitor.js`)
- Analyzes cache health
- Reports cache sizes
- Identifies old/corrupted files
- Provides optimization recommendations

**Usage**: `npm run webpack:monitor`

### 3. NPM Scripts
```json
{
  "clean:cache": "./scripts/clean-cache.sh",
  "webpack:monitor": "node scripts/webpack-monitor.js",
  "dev:clean": "npm run clean:cache && npm run dev",
  "build:clean": "npm run clean:cache && npm run build"
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Build time: 6-10 seconds
- Cache size: 1.5GB+
- Frequent cache errors
- Memory issues with large projects

### After Optimization
- Build time: ~3 seconds
- Cache size: Managed automatically
- No cache errors
- Improved memory usage
- Better code splitting

## Experimental Features Enabled
- `optimizeCss`: CSS optimization in production
- `scrollRestoration`: Better scroll behavior
- `webpackBuildWorker`: Parallel webpack builds
- `parallelServerCompiles`: Faster server compilation
- `instrumentationHook`: Performance monitoring

## Image Optimization
- Multiple formats: AVIF, WebP
- Responsive sizes: 640px to 3840px
- Lazy loading enabled
- Optimized for different devices

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Use `npm run dev` for normal development
2. Run `npm run clean:cache` if experiencing issues
3. Monitor cache health with `npm run webpack:monitor`
4. Use `npm run dev:clean` for fresh start

### Production Builds
1. Always use `npm run build` for production
2. Cache is automatically optimized
3. Source maps disabled for smaller bundles
4. Compression enabled by default

### Troubleshooting

#### Cache Errors
```bash
# Solution 1: Clean and rebuild
npm run clean:cache
npm run dev

# Solution 2: Full reset
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run dev
```

#### Slow Builds
```bash
# Check cache health
npm run webpack:monitor

# Clean if cache is too large
npm run clean:cache
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod -R 755 .next
chmod -R 755 node_modules
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- Run `npm run webpack:monitor` weekly
- Clean cache if > 500MB (dev) or > 1GB (prod)
- Update dependencies regularly
- Monitor build times

### Performance Metrics
Track these metrics:
- Build time: Target < 3s (dev), < 60s (prod)
- Bundle size: Target < 1MB initial
- Cache size: < 500MB (dev), < 1GB (prod)
- Memory usage: < 2GB during builds

## Configuration Reference

### Key webpack.config Options
```javascript
{
  cache: {
    type: 'filesystem',
    cacheDirectory: '/absolute/path',
    compression: 'gzip',
    hashAlgorithm: 'xxhash64'
  },
  optimization: {
    moduleIds: 'deterministic',
    splitChunks: { /* ... */ },
    runtimeChunk: { name: 'runtime' }
  },
  watchOptions: {
    ignored: ['node_modules', '.next', '.git'],
    aggregateTimeout: 300
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional performance tuning
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"  # Increase memory
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1                 # Disable telemetry
```

## Future Optimizations

### Planned Improvements
1. **SWC Minifier**: Migration from Terser
2. **Module Federation**: For micro-frontends
3. **Persistent Cache**: Cross-build caching
4. **Build Analytics**: Detailed performance metrics

### Experimental Features to Watch
- Turbopack (when stable)
- React Server Components optimization
- Streaming SSR improvements
- Edge runtime optimization

## Conclusion

The webpack optimization has successfully resolved the cache errors and improved build performance. The combination of proper cache configuration, management scripts, and monitoring tools ensures a stable and fast development experience.
