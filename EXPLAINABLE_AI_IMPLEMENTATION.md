# Explainable AI Implementation for Annual Report AI

## Overview
Successfully implemented an Explainable AI feature for the Annual Report AI module that provides passage references and evidence trails for all AI-generated insights.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure
- Modified insights to include evidence arrays with:
  - Direct quotes from the source document
  - Page numbers for reference
  - Character positions for precise highlighting
  - Confidence scores for each piece of evidence
  - AI reasoning explaining why the evidence supports the insight

### 2. Split-View Layout
- **40% Analysis Panel (Left)**: Displays AI insights with evidence cards
- **60% Document Preview (Right)**: Shows the source document with highlighted passages
- Toggle between split-view and full-width layouts

### 3. Evidence Cards Component (`EvidenceCard.tsx`)
- Visual cards showing insights with supporting evidence
- Color-coded by insight type (positive/warning/negative)
- Interactive evidence items with:
  - Quoted text from the document
  - Page references
  - Confidence indicators
  - AI reasoning explanations
- Click-to-view functionality for jumping to document sections

### 4. Document Viewer Component (`DocumentViewer.tsx`)
- Real-time document preview with:
  - Highlighted evidence passages
  - Color-coded highlights matching insight types
  - Zoom controls (50%-200%)
  - Page navigation
  - Synchronized scrolling to active evidence
- Interactive highlights that respond to clicks

### 5. Synchronized Interaction
- Clicking evidence in the insight panel highlights it in the document
- Document highlights are clickable to show related insights
- Smooth scrolling to relevant sections
- Active evidence tracking across both panels

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components
- `/src/features/annual-report-ai/DocumentViewer.tsx` - Document preview with highlighting
- `/src/features/annual-report-ai/EvidenceCard.tsx` - Evidence display cards

### Modified Files
- `/src/app/dashboard/annual-report-ai/page.tsx` - Enhanced with split-view and evidence system

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly why the AI made each conclusion
2. **Verifiability**: Direct quotes and page references allow manual verification
3. **Interactivity**: Click-through navigation between insights and source material
4. **Flexibility**: Toggle between focused split-view and full-width analysis
5. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded highlights for different insight types

## Technical Implementation

### Evidence Structure
```typescript
interface Evidence {
  id: string
  quote: string
  pageNumber: number
  startChar?: number
  endChar?: number
  confidence: number
  reasoning: string
}
```

### Insight Structure
```typescript
interface InsightWithEvidence {
  id: string
  type: 'positive' | 'warning' | 'negative'
  title: string
  description: string
  confidence: number
  evidences: Evidence[]
  impact?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  category?: string
}
```

## Example Evidence Trail

**Insight**: "Revenue Growth - 23% YoY increase"
- **Evidence 1**: "Total revenue for fiscal year 2024 reached $2.3 billion..." (Page 12, 95% confidence)
- **Evidence 2**: "This growth significantly outpaced the industry average..." (Page 14, 88% confidence)
- **AI Reasoning**: "Direct statement from financial statements confirms revenue figures"

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **PDF Integration**: Integrate actual PDF rendering library for real document viewing
2. **Search Functionality**: Add text search within documents
3. **Export Features**: Export analysis with evidence references
4. **Multi-Document Support**: Analyze multiple reports simultaneously
5. **ML Model Integration**: Connect to actual AI/ML models for real-time analysis

## Usage

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Annual Report AI
2. Click "Analyze Report" tab
3. Upload a document or select from assets
4. Click "Analyze with AI"
5. View results in split-view with evidence trails
6. Click on evidence items to navigate to source passages
7. Toggle between split and full-width views as needed
