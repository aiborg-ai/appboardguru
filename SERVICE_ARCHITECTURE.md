# AppBoardGuru Service Layer Architecture

## Overview

The AppBoardGuru service layer implements a comprehensive microservices-style architecture with dependency injection, event-driven communication, and robust orchestration patterns. This document outlines service boundaries, contracts, and architectural patterns implemented by Team Gamma Agent 2.

## Architecture Principles

- **Dependency Injection**: All services are managed through the ServiceFactory with singleton lifecycle management
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through domain events via EventBus
- **Result Pattern**: All service operations return Result<T> for consistent error handling
- **Service Orchestration**: Complex workflows are managed through ServiceOrchestrator
- **Health Monitoring**: All services are monitored for performance and availability

## Service Factory & Dependency Injection

### ServiceFactory
```typescript
class ServiceFactory {
  // Core domain services
  get users(): UserService
  get assets(): AssetService
  get vaults(): VaultService
  get notifications(): NotificationService
  get documents(): DocumentService
  get calendar(): CalendarService
  get search(): SearchService
  
  // Business logic services
  get workflow(): WorkflowService
  get compliance(): ComplianceService
  get board(): BoardService
  get voice(): VoiceService
  
  // Infrastructure services
  get eventBus(): EventBus
  get orchestrator(): ServiceOrchestrator
  get monitor(): ServiceMonitor
}
```

### Usage Pattern
```typescript
import { getServiceFactory } from '@/lib/services'

const services = getServiceFactory(supabase)

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Domain Events

All services publish domain events for significant business actions:

```typescript
interface DomainEvent {
  id: string
  type: string
  aggregateId: string
  aggregateType: string
  data: Record<string, any>
  metadata: {
    version: number
    timestamp: number
    userId?: string
    correlationId?: string
    causationId?: string
  }
}
```

### Event Categories

1. **Entity Lifecycle Events**: `*.created`, `*.updated`, `*.deleted`
2. **Business Process Events**: `workflow.*`, `board.meeting.*`, `compliance.*`
3. **User Interaction Events**: `user.login`, `voice.command.*`, `document.viewed`
4. **System Events**: `service.health.*`, `performance.threshold.*`

### Event Handlers

Services can subscribe to events from other services:

```typescript
// In WorkflowService constructor
eventBus.subscribe('user.profile.updated', async (event) => {
  await this.updateWorkflowAssignments(event.aggregateId)
})
```

## Service Communication Patterns

### 1. Direct Service Calls
For simple operations within the same bounded context:
```typescript
const userProfile = await services.users.getUserProfile(userId)
```

### 2. Event-Driven Communication
For cross-boundary operations and loose coupling:
```typescript
await eventBus.publish(eventBus.createEvent(
  'document.uploaded',
  documentId,
  { documentType, uploadedBy: userId }
))
```

### 3. Orchestrated Workflows
For complex business processes:
```typescript
const result = await services.orchestrator.executeWorkflow('document-approval', {
  documentId,
  requestedBy: userId,
  approvers: ['manager@company.com']
})
```

### 4. Saga Pattern
For distributed transactions with compensation:
```typescript
const sagaSteps = [
  {
    execute: () => services.assets.reserveStorage(fileSize),
    compensate: () => services.assets.releaseStorage(fileSize)
  },
  {
    execute: () => services.documents.processDocument(documentId),
    compensate: () => services.documents.markProcessingFailed(documentId)
  }
]

await services.orchestrator.executeSaga(sagaSteps)
```

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Result Pattern
All service methods return `Result<T>` for consistent error handling:

```typescript
const result = await services.users.getUserProfile(userId)
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Profile:', result.data)
} else {
  console.error('Error:', result.error)
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Automatic failure detection and recovery for external dependencies:

```typescript
// Configured in ServiceOrchestrator
circuitBreakerConfig: {
  failureThreshold: 5,
  recoveryTimeout: 30000,
  monitoringPeriod: 10000
}
```

### Retry Logic
Configurable retry with exponential backoff:

```typescript
await this.executeWithRetry(
  () => externalApiCall(),
  { maxRetries: 3, backoffMs: 1000 }
)
```

## Performance & Monitoring

### Service Budgets
Performance budgets are defined for each service type:

- **Page Services**: 50ms max render time
- **Modal Services**: 16ms max render time  
- **List Services**: 25ms max render time
- **Form Services**: 16ms max render time

### Health Checks
All services implement health check endpoints:

```typescript
interface HealthCheckResult {
  status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy'
  details?: {
    dependencies: Record<string, 'healthy' | 'unhealthy'>
    metrics: {
      responseTime: number
      errorRate: number
      throughput: number
    }
  }
}
```

### Metrics Collection
Automatic collection of:
- Request/response times
- Error rates and types
- Throughput metrics
- Resource utilization
- Event processing times

## Security & Access Control

### Permission-Based Access
All services integrate with the permission system:

```typescript
// BaseService provides permission checking
async checkPermissions(
  action: string,
  resource: string,
  context?: Record<string, any>
): Promise<Result<boolean>>
```

### Activity Logging
All service actions are logged for audit purposes:

```typescript
// Automatic activity logging in BaseService
await this.logActivity(action, resourceType, resourceId, metadata)
```

### Data Privacy
Services implement data privacy controls:
- PII data masking in logs
- GDPR compliance for data deletion
- Encrypted data storage for sensitive information

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Each service has comprehensive unit tests:
- Method-level testing with mocked dependencies
- Error scenario testing
- Performance benchmark testing

### Integration Testing
Service interaction testing:
- Event flow testing
- Workflow execution testing
- Cross-service communication testing

### Contract Testing
API contract verification:
- Service interface compatibility
- Event schema validation
- Database schema migrations

## Deployment & Scaling

### Service Independence
Each service can be deployed independently:
- Separate build pipelines
- Independent scaling policies
- Rolling deployment support

### Configuration Management
Environment-specific configuration:
- Database connection strings
- External service endpoints
- Feature flags and toggles

### Monitoring & Alerting
Production monitoring:
- Service health dashboards
- Performance alerts
- Error rate monitoring
- SLA compliance tracking

## Migration Strategy

### Gradual Migration
Services are being migrated gradually:
1. **Phase 1**: Core domain services (User, Asset, Vault)
2. **Phase 2**: Business logic services (Workflow, Compliance, Board)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced services (Voice, AI integration)

### Backward Compatibility
Legacy API compatibility maintained during migration:
- Adapter pattern for old interfaces
- Feature flags for new functionality
- Gradual deprecation of old endpoints

## Best Practices

### Service Design
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Domain-Driven Design boundaries
- Stateless service design
- Idempotent operations

### Error Handling
- Consistent Result pattern usage
- Meaningful error messages
- Proper error classification
- Graceful degradation

### Performance

- Permission-based access control
- Audit logging for all actions
- Secure credential management

## Conclusion

The AppBoardGuru service layer provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture for complex business operations. The combination of dependency injection, event-driven communication, and comprehensive monitoring creates a system that can evolve with changing business requirements while maintaining high performance and reliability.

The service boundaries are clearly defined with minimal coupling between domains, enabling independent development and deployment of different business capabilities. The event-driven architecture provides flexibility for future integrations and business process changes.
